- 👋 Hi, I’m user @Hahubel1, that's first name, last name, sequence number 2+5+1. 
- 👀 I'm retired now, but was designing ERP software modules in different languages for more than 30 years. And I’m still interested in software development.  
- 🌱 I need hands-on practice - every so often - depending on my mood.
- 💞️ I'm enjoying myself, looking around.
- 📫 Don't reach out to me, I will reach out to you...
